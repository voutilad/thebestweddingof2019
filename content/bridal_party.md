It was also a full Bonvini Family celebration when Megan got her driver's license in her 20s.


<b>Co-Maid of Honor Laura Placentino</b>: Friendship established September, 1987. Cousins. Friends. Basically sisters. It will only take you about 3 minutes of hanging out with these two to realize that they can finish each other's sentences.

<b>Bridesmaid Sarah Q. Reynolds</b>: Adrienne and Sarah have been friends since the golden age of Will Farrell’s comedy career. Always ready for adventure, Sarah is Adrienne’s go to friend for camping and spontaneous day trips.
