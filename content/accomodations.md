We've reserved a block of rooms at the following Waterville Valley hotels, specifically those that include air conditioning and are *"hotel style"* (vs. renting a condo).

* [Silver Fox Inn](https://silverfoxinn.com/) -- hotel-style accomodations including a continental breakfast
* [Valley Inn](https://www.valleyinn.com/) -- offers modern hotel-style amenities, many accomodating up to six people

For more information on the above locations, please check out [this pdf](/files/wedding-rooms.pdf) that contains pricing and more detailed descriptions.

To book, please contact [Waterville Valley Central Reservations](http://www.waterville.com/lodging/) online or via phone at `1-800-GO-VALLEY`, pressing `1` for "lodging reservations."

Various accomodations are available throughout the valley beyond those in our room block, including multi-bedroom condos! Feel free to book anything you find through their central reservations system if the Silver Fox or Valley Inn don't meet your needs.

**Childcare Services:** please note that our reception will be an *adults-only affair.*

If you'd like to bring the whole family and take advantage of the weekend make sure you either BYO-childcare or make arrangements with a local babysitter. Waterville Valley maintains a [list of local babysitters](/files/babysitter.pdf).
