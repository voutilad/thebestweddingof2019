We've reserved a block of rooms at the following Waterville Valley hotels, specifically those that include air conditioning and are *"hotel style"* (vs. renting a condo).

* [Silver Fox Inn](https://silverfoxinn.com/) -- hotel-style accomodations including a continental breakfast
* [Valley Inn](https://www.valleyinn.com/) -- offers modern hotel-style amenities, many accomodating up to six people

Other accomodations are available throughout the valley including multi-bedroom condos! If you don't like the price or options with our chosen room blocks please feel free to book anything you find through their central reservations system.

For bookings, please contact [Waterville Valley Central Reservations](http://www.waterville.com/lodging/) online or via phone at `1-800-GO-VALLEY`.

**An important note about booking:** our reception will be an *adults-only affair.* Please keep this in mind. If you'd like to bring the whole family and take advantage of the weekend make sure you either BYO-childcare or make arrangements with a local service.
