**The Best Man: Jason Gronlund** ("Jay"): A fellow survivor of Naragansett Regional High School, class of 2001, Jay has known Dave the longest...from the times he got beaned twice in the head during a jr. high baseball game to seeing Vladimir Guerrero Jr hit multiple dingers for the New Hampshire Fisher Cats in a game vs. Tim Tebow. Oh, and they both also graduated from the same college (WPI, 2005) and are members of the same fraternity. All without trying coordinate it, if you can believe it!

**Tim Krawiec** ("TK"): The one time Tim decided to go running his Freshman year of college, Dave creepily chased him down to talk him into going to a rush event. Since then, Tim has been a part of many exciting adventures in Dave's life from their times sharing responsibilites as officers in the fraternity to re-enacting the Whiskey Rebellion and numerous Foxwoods trips.

**Mathew Densmore** ("MattyD"): Yet another WPI and Alpha Chi Rho alum, Matty typically organized a lot of the activities so this wedding is the rare occasion he's not involved in planning. Having left the harsh New England weather behind and retreating to Pasadena, he's also probably traveling the furthest to the wedding!

**TBA**: Mystery Man! Shhhh...Dave's still to ask him.
