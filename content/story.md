    <b>The place</b>: Tommy Doyle’s Harvard Square (RIP)
</p>

It was a typical Sunday spent playing kickball at Cambridge Common followed by a disproportionate amount of time (the now defunct) Tommy Doyle’s Irish Pub, where all members of the World Adult Kickball Association's Massachusetts Ivy League gathered after games. Adrienne had finished her surgical rotation of PA school the Friday before and for once didn’t have to bring her index cards to study on the kickball field. After a few rounds of flip cup with her team, she noticed that there was a lone green team ("Ballsagna") player at the bar who looked like he might be ready to flip some cups. That lone player was the one and only, Dave Voutila II. Dave was impressed with her skills at the flip cup table and somehow managed to get her phone number.

Their first date will always be remembered as the day Cadel Evans took the yellow jersey in the Tour de France in 2011.  Dave spent the morning watching the tour with his friends, and Adrienne spent the day at the beach with her friends. That evening they were to meet at Park St. Station to go out for drinks near Boston Common. In classic Adrienne and Dave fashion, they each ended up at different Park St. Station exits and both were getting a bit worried that their prospective date was standing them up. After this first hiccup they finally met up to decide where to go for drinks where they decided it was too damn hot for drinks, and instead went out for ice cream. It was this pivotal decision that spurred into everlasting love.

Now 7+ years later they’ve settled down in Vermont with their cat Cora and their golden retriever Maple (whose adventures you can follow on instagram [@maplebtv](https://www.instagram.com/maplebtv/)). They love living in Vermont where skiing, hiking, biking and kayaking are all a stone’s throw away.
